# TODO / ISSUES

- Figure out nicer template modification when armor changes
- Find list of Monster Tags
? Mounts can wear some form of armor, too - how should it be represented
? Potential issue: Roll rendering for negative values, ex. 2d6-2
? Remove/filter out Value 0 from rolls
? Could rolls support expressions such as 6 * (d10 + 2)
x Ability scores: how to handle cases like racial traits, where an Ability Score is increased from the original roll?
x Ability scores: how to denote Ability Score increased from the original roll for a "boss"?
