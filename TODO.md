# TODO / ISSUES

- out-of-turn activities, ex: opportunity attack
- crossing creature space and size 

## Backlog

- Weapons/attacks that are "natural", ex Claw
- Weapon proficiency bonus and Hit Dice
- Proficiency, Light/Heavy weapons
- Multi Attacks
- Representing Advantage, Disadvantage Roll
- Figure out nicer template modification when armor changes
- Find list of Monster Tags
? Is there an equivalent to Proficiency for Monsters
? Mounts can wear some form of armor, too - how should it be represented
? Potential issue: Roll rendering for negative values, ex. 2d6-2
? Remove/filter out Value 0 from rolls
? Could rolls support expressions such as 6 * (d10 + 2)
x Ability scores: how to handle cases like racial traits, where an Ability Score is increased from the original roll?
x Ability scores: how to denote Ability Score increased from the original roll for a "boss"?
