# TODO / ISSUES

- weapon equipped, equip, sheath, drop
- handling of creatures leaving battle map
- crossing creature space and size 
- Multi Attacks: 1 Action, 2 Attacks
- record full detail of attack (attack roll, crit, adv/dis, ...)
- review if exception cases can be avoided for outcomes like disengage, ... that are never reactions
- add bonus actions

## Backlog

- Weapon proficiency bonus and Hit Dice
- Figure out nicer template modification when armor changes
- Find list of Monster Tags
? Is there an equivalent to Proficiency for Monsters
? Mounts can wear some form of armor, too - how should it be represented
? Potential issue: Roll rendering for negative values, ex. 2d6-2
? Remove/filter out Value 0 from rolls
? Could rolls support expressions such as 6 * (d10 + 2)
x Ability scores: how to handle cases like racial traits, where an Ability Score is increased from the original roll?
x Ability scores: how to denote Ability Score increased from the original roll for a "boss"?
x Proficiency, Light/Heavy weapons
x display of events in journal (ex: result of an attack)
x representation of allies and enemies
x out-of-turn activities, ex: opportunity attack
x Weapons/attacks that are "natural", ex Claw
x representing Advantage, Disadvantage Roll
x outcome for actions such as Dash or Dodge
